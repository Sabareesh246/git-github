I have created the github centralised repository and have synced the repository with my local and pull the master branch to my local repository

Need to create a github account by using URL github.com
Sabareesh246
Sabarish@123

after that create a direcctory in local with the same repository name(git-github)
then initialise the git
git init

after that we need to get the git hub repositroy to out local

git remote add origin "URL of the repository"

now we need to pull the brach to local

git pull origin master

it will get the details that are in the git hub and now we need to create a file and add the sample data in the file and then add the data and 
do the commit and then push the file to the central repository

git add .

git status

git commit -m "First Commit"

git push origin master(It will ask the github login details then it will write the object to the repository and we can the changes under the 
repository and we also the commit id in UI as well as from the git bash

git log

git log --author="Sabareesh Bilakanti"


git log -- since="2 days ago"

git show commitID - it will display the commit details that are done for the file.
