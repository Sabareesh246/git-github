I have created the github centralised repository and have synced the repository with my local and pull the master branch to my local repository

Need to create a github account by using URL github.com
Sabareesh246
Sabarish@123

after that create a direcctory in local with the same repository name(git-github)
then initialise the git
git init

after that we need to get the git hub repositroy to out local

git remote add origin "URL of the repository"

now we need to pull the brach to local

git pull origin master
